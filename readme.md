# HealthTracker App

Team project as part of GirlDevelopIt 2021 Hackathon. We didn't have any back-end people on the team, so it's a front-end proof of concept that can be seen [here](https://technomom.github.io/healthtracker/dashboard.html). The [presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dNR2UbAVC9gBG2niJt9QEcyELSauXffI/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107573989791911867070&rtpof=true&sd=true) are available, as well.
